					The table above shows my web development skills where my skills are mostly in the level of 'None' and 'Beginner'. I would like to learn more about the web development and that is the reason I chose it! Maybe I am not a good programmer but I do like designing, especially on user interface. Therefore for this project I would like to improve the skill of 'Creating a responsive user interface with HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript', which is the first option shown in the table.

			<h2>Work Division</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left">
				This project is developed by a team of two members. The project will be divided into two major parts which are the back-end and front-end concepts. Based on the discussion, we agreed to divide our responsibilities significantly into two main tasks. 
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: left">
				In conclusion, Zhenfeng will be working more on front-end Graphical User Interface Design whereas Shirlyn will be working more on back-end coding implementation.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: left">
				However, for further extend of our development on the project, we will coorperate and implicit our responsibilities without clear define line as the completion of the project is ambiguous.
